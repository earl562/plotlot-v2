"""Agent harness runtime boundary.

This package holds the orchestration layer that ties together:

- typed tool contracts (`plotlot.land_use.models.ToolContract`)
- policy decisions (`plotlot.land_use.policy.ToolPolicy`)
- context brokering
- audit/event emission

The intent is to keep domain evidence modeling in `plotlot.land_use/*` and keep
transport adapters (REST/chat/MCP) thin wrappers over the same harness runtime.
